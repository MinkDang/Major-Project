	<h2>Development Roadmap</h2>
	<a href="https://minhdangwork.notion.site/Build-b99cdbf3a1244a35a886dc8a3602236c">notion.so</a>
	<h1>Version 1</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="./v1/v1.01.html">v1.01</a> shows the structure of the page with simple JS
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="./v1/v1.02.html">v1.02</a> optimises v1.01 and works on minor functions
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="./v1/v1.03.html">v1.03</a> focuses on array of records and input validation
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="./v1/v1.04.html">v1.04</a> focuses on reset button and optimisation of the code, especially enforcing
		harsher validation
	</p>
	<h1>Version 2</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="./v2/v2.01.html">v2.01</a> focuses on changing all possible divs to forms which would be beneficial for
		future database implementation
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="./v2/v2.02.html">v2.02</a> focuses on the floating side bar
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="./v2/v2.03.html">v2.03</a> focuses on using checked attributes as a way to change buttons colors
		Moreover, some mitigated problems are:
	<ul>
		<li>Selecting text on a label</li>
		<li>Reseting undefined variables</li>
	</ul>
	Floating point errors that appears when 2 toppings are added and removed are mitigated <strong>temporarily</strong>
	through an 'if' condition. Find more about these errors <a href="https://floating-point-gui.de/">here</a>
	<br>
	An error that could not be resolved is related to the behaviour of checked attributes in checkboxes.
	This error does not prove to be dangerous to the user experience and security. It will be patched if possible in
	future versions
